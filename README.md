## Description

The most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This Full Stack MERN database project was to create a Book Search Engine that is MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, and to wrap it all up, to be able to work using Heroko server. The starter code was that it was already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
